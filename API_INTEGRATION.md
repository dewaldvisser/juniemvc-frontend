## Getting Started

1. **Start your Spring Boot API**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure your Spring Boot application is running on:
   # http://localhost:8080
   ```

2. **Start the Next.js development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Data Flow

1. **Dashboard** loads overview statistics from all API endpoints
2. **Management pages** provide full CRUD operations for each resource
3. **Forms** submit data to Spring Boot API endpoints
4. **Real-time updates** refresh data after successful operations
5. **Error handling** displays user-friendly messages for API failures
